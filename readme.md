PidCheck
--------

PidCheck is a generic crawler for extracting data about PiD's from landing pages and doing some calculation on the health of the link.
It is based upon the [Scrapy](https://scrapy.org/) framework for doing most of the hard work.
It is configured for broad crawling to hit multiple domains and does this in a polite way by default.
